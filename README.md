## Features

### Props

"Props" is short for "properties," and it's a mechanism for passing data from a
parent component to a child component. Props are read-only and help make React
applications more dynamic and flexible.

### useState

`useState` is a hook in React that allows functional components to manage and
update their internal state. It takes an initial state value as an argument and
returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update
it.

### useEffect

`useEffect` is a hook in React that enables functional components to perform
side effects. It takes two arguments: a function containing the code for the
side effect and an optional dependency array.

## Project Details

- **Project Purpose:** This project is a website for a company that offers
  various courses for purchase, with a maximum limit on the number of courses
  that can be bought.

- **Framework:** To enhance the project's visual appeal, I used the Tailwind CSS
  framework for styling.

- **Type of Project:** This is a single-page website, designed to provide a
  seamless user experience.

- **API:** I created a fake API in JSON format to simulate course data,
  including course names, descriptions, prices, and more.

- **Alert Notifications:** A user-friendly alert notification system is in place
  to inform users when they reach the maximum item limit or when they have a
  minimum number of hours remaining.

- **Development:** The project was successfully deployed on Surge, and it
  underwent thorough testing to ensure a smooth user experience.

- **Testing:** The project underwent extensive testing, including unit testing
  and user testing, to address any potential issues.

- **Challenges Faced:** During development, I encountered challenges with
  conditional rendering, particularly in managing maximum item limits and
  remaining hours. These challenges were resolved through careful
  problem-solving.

- **Live Site:** You can access the live site demo at [Your Live Site URL] and
  view the repository at [Your Repository URL].

- **Future Improvements:** In the future, I plan to add a purchase button to
  make the user experience even more realistic and complete.
